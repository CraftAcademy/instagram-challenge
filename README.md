# Instagram Challenge

This educational project is a work in progress.  The idea is to create an Instagram clone with Rails.

## Tests

I spent so much time "spiking" to try to figure out various things, such as how to upload images to S3 via Heroku with Paperclip that no tests have been written yet (but that is changing as I write this).

## Status - Development

The current version of the app works locally, at least for me since I have my AWS credentials stored in an ENV variable.

## Status - Production

The app is not yet working in production.  I have been troubleshooting my code and various configurations having to do with Paperclip, Heroku, and S3, but have been encouraged to move on to other things, which is what I have done.

## Future

I'll update this README file as may be warranted in the future.

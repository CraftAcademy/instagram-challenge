# Instagram Challenge

This educational project is a work in progress.  The idea is to create an Instagram clone with Rails using TDD/BDD.  However, I spent so much time "spiking" to try to figure out various things, such as how to upload images to S3 via Heroku with Paperclip the gem that no tests have been written yet.

## Status - Development

The app is nowhere near complete, but the current version does work locally, at least for me since I have my AWS credentials stored in an ENV variable.

## Status - Production

The app is not yet working on Heroku.  I have been troubleshooting that for some hours now and am calling it quits for the night.

## Future

I'll update this README file as may be warranted in the future.
